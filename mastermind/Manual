To play the game, you first enter the name of the 
program:

bash$ mastermind

then it asks you if two places can be the same color.
If you say no here, two places cant be the same color, but
if you say y, the color combination can be, for eksample,
red, red, red, red. (which makes it harder)

then it asks for tries. If you want really many tries, you have
to widen you'r terminal a bit. There can be 1 try pr. 3 colums.

It then finds the combination it wants to use, and a few nanoseconds
later, you can press enter.

Now it asks for a place. You could for eksample press 1.
Then it asks for a color. You could for eksample press 3 for blue.
A blue box now pops up at place 1 on the first try.
When you have given 4 colors on diffrent places, it asks you if
you want to make that count as a try. If you want,
it finds out how many right colors on right places
and how many right colors on wrong places you have placed,
and goes on to try number 2 (if you did'nt enter 1 when it asked for tries.)

You just keep on like that, till you either guess the right combination
or run out of tries.

If you are unlucky enough to run out of tries, it will be kind
enough to show the right combination.


Great fun, that!
