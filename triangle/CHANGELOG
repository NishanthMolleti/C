Version 2.2

*ALL VERSIONS BELOW 2.2 CONTAINS CALCULATION ERRORS*

A typing error was discovered in the function twosides(),
which caused a calculation error if you gave angle 
B with the sides b and c.
(solution 2)

The entire twosides function has been the most buggy part of the program
so far, so now i have decided to rewrite it.

In this version, the program first rotates the triangle, so it always
get angle A, nomatter what angle was specified and calculates that.
Then, before giving output, it simply rotates it back again.

This means that there is only one angle case to take care of.
(And a heavily reduced chance of typing errors.)


Also a minor input validation error when the program 
sees if it has enought information to generate a new side
using the area() function has been fixeed. Now it's only activated
if there is one side and one angle (and not 2 angles or 2 sides)


Version 2.1:

A little has been changed.
The way the program accepts user input now makes it a bit easier
for the user to input the triangle.
Whenever the program has three informations about the triangle,
it skips the rest (so the user won't have to type a lot of zeros
if he has 2 sides and angle A for example).

Then Torben Vinther <tvinter@sol.dk> has designed a very nice Windows Explorer
file icon for the program, so the program looks more "user freindly" in Windows.


Version 2.0:

Cool feature added.
Now you don't have to know more then two things about
the triangle if you have the area!!

This feature was incredibly easy to add, so i can't see
why i have'nt done this before.
But here it is: version 2.0!

Version 1.1.1:

Fixed a few typing errors which resulted in bad output,
in the function twosides().
In case angle B or C was given with the sides b and c
it overrode the usergiven variables and not the free variables,
so the triangle went wrong.

Try using version 1.1 and type, lets say, 
a: 0
b: 5
c: 5
A: 0
b: 50
c: 0
and you'll see.

Version 1.1:

Fixed a little issue where certain triangles would be solution()ed
even if they are not possible to make in the real world.

Version 1.0:

The finished program.

Enter 3 things about a triangle, and the program will give you the rest,
and the area of the triangle.
The 3 things you have to give to it is either sides or angles.
