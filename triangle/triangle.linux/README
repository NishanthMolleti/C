You feed this program with 3 informations about a triangle,
for example two sides and an angle. The program will then
find the other sides and angles in the triangle, and it
will also find the area of the triangle.

You can alternatly choose to give it 2 things about the triangle,
for example an angle and a side and then the area of the triangle,
then this program will also find the rest.

Note that this job is impossible if you give it angle
A and side a,
B and side b,
C and side c.
