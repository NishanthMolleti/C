The program is quite simple.
To decrypt something, use
"crypt key data"
with key being the name of the key file and data
being the name of the encrypted file.

The program asks if the filename seems right.
If it isn't (eg it's scrambled data)
the keyfile and encrypted file dosn't match.
Otherwise, just type "y".


Encrypting goes like this:
"crypt key data encrypt"
where key is the key, data is the cleartext
and encrypt signals that the data is supposed
to be encrypted.
It will ask for a filename to the encrypted
file.
